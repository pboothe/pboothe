Hello! I'm currently founding Triple Pat ([@triple-pat](https://github.com/triple-pat) or [triplepat.com](https://triplepat.com)). I should know if it's on a successful path by February 2025.  That means I'm writing Go, Swift, and Kotlin for the systems involved, and I'm writing lots of shell and Dockerfiles and YAML and other configs to hold it all together.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [Triple Pat](https://triplepat.com)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Swift and Kotlin
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about:
  -  software reliability,
  -  development practices that promote high-quality software,
  -  the Internet, and
  -  moving to the Netherlands as an American
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: I'm pboothe in most namespaces. If you are Patricia or Paul and you are reading this: [please stop telling people pboothe at gmail is your email address](https://xkcd.com/1279/). It's not (it's mine, and has been since Gmail was launched in 2004), and I don't know where to forward your mail along to, because I only know what your email address isn't.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I stopped attending school after I completed the 23rd grade.

If you are just trolling for resumes, mine can be found at [pboothe.github.io](https://pboothe.github.io).
