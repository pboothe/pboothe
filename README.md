Hello! I'm currently founding Triple Pat ([@triple-pat](https://github.com/triple-pat) or [triplepat.com](https://triplepat.com)). I should know if it's on a successful path by February 2025.  That means I'm writing Go, Swift, and Kotlin for the systems involved, and I'm writing lots of shell and dockerfules and YAML to hold it all together.

If you are just trolling for resumes, mine can be found at [pboothe.github.io](https://pboothe.github.io).

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Triple Pat

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about the Internet infrastructure or moving to the Netherlands as an American
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: I'm pboothe in most namespaces. If you are Patricia or Paul: [please stop telling people pboothe is your email address](https://xkcd.com/1279/). It's not, and I don't know where to forward your mail along to, because I only know what your email address isn't.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I stopped attending school after I completed the 23rd grade.
